Okay, here's a task list to implement the Dependency Version Dashboard based on your TDD. I've broken it down into phases for clarity.

📋 Project Task List: Dependency Version Dashboard

## Phase 1: Initial Setup & Script Core Logic ✅ COMPLETED

### Project Initialization: ✅ COMPLETED

✅ Create a new GitHub repository (e.g., dependency-dashboard).

✅ Clone the repository locally.

✅ Create the basic directory structure:

docs/

scripts/

.github/workflows/

✅ Create an initial README.md.

✅ Create a .gitignore file (e.g., for Python virtual environments, IDE files).

### scripts/check_versions.py - Input & Configuration: ✅ COMPLETED

✅ Define how the script will get the list of dependencies (e.g., hardcode the initial iOS list from TDD directly in the script or in a simple JSON/list variable within the script).

✅ Implement parsing of GitHub repo URLs to extract owner/repo name.

### scripts/check_versions.py - GitHub API Interaction (Core): ✅ COMPLETED

✅ Implement function to fetch latest release tag for a given owner/repo using GitHub API (/repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases/latest or /repos/{owner}/{repo}/tags).

✅ Consider: Some repos might not use "releases" and only tags. Prioritize releases, fallback to tags.

✅ Consider: Semantic version sorting if fetching all tags.

✅ Implement function to fetch the latest commit SHA for a branch (for dependencies like "Reachability" tracking master).

✅ Add basic error handling for API requests (e.g., repo not found, no releases/tags, network issues).

### scripts/check_versions.py - Data Processing & Output: ✅ COMPLETED

✅ For each dependency:

✅ Compare current version with the fetched latest version/commit.

✅ Determine the status ("✅ Up to Date", "⚠️ Update Available", "ℹ️ Tracks Branch", "🚨 Error Checking").

✅ Add notes for errors or branch tracking.

✅ Structure the collected data according to the docs/data.json format specified in the TDD.

✅ Implement writing the structured data to docs/data.json.

✅ Add a top-level last_updated timestamp (ISO 8601 format) to the data.json output (e.g., as a root key or within a metadata object).

### Initial Script Testing: ✅ COMPLETED

✅ Manually run check_versions.py with the iOS dependencies.

✅ Verify the contents and format of the generated docs/data.json.

## Phase 2: Dashboard UI (docs/index.html) ✅ COMPLETED

### Basic HTML Structure: ✅ COMPLETED

✅ Create docs/index.html.

✅ Set up a basic HTML page with a title, a placeholder for "Last Updated", and an empty table structure (<table><thead><tr>...</tr></thead><tbody></tbody></table>).

### JavaScript - Data Fetching & Rendering: ✅ COMPLETED

✅ Write JavaScript (inline or in a separate script.js linked in index.html) to:

✅ Fetch docs/data.json using the fetch API.

✅ Parse the JSON data.

✅ Populate the "Last Updated" placeholder from the last_updated field in data.json.

✅ Dynamically create table rows (<tr>) and cells (<td>) in the <tbody> for each dependency.

✅ Display: Name, URL (as a clickable link), Current Version, Latest Version, Status, Notes.

### UI Styling & Polish: ✅ COMPLETED

✅ Add basic CSS (inline <style> or separate style.css) for readability (e.g., table borders, padding).

✅ Implement conditional styling for the "Status" column (e.g., different background colors or icons based on status value).

### Local UI Testing: ✅ COMPLETED

✅ Open docs/index.html in a browser to verify data loading and display.

✅ Ensure links and conditional styling work as expected.

## Phase 3: Automation with GitHub Actions (.github/workflows/update.yml) ✅ COMPLETED

### Workflow File Creation: ✅ COMPLETED

✅ Create .github/workflows/update.yml.

### Workflow Triggers: ✅ COMPLETED

✅ Configure on: schedule: for weekly runs (e.g., Monday 9 AM UTC).

✅ Add on: workflow_dispatch: for manual triggering.

### Job Definition - Setup: ✅ COMPLETED

✅ Define a job (e.g., update-dependencies).

✅ Specify runs-on: ubuntu-latest.

✅ Add step to checkout the repository (actions/checkout@v3 or newer).

✅ Add step to set up Python (actions/setup-python@v3 or newer).

✅ Add step to install Python dependencies (e.g., pip install requests if used).

### Job Definition - Script Execution & Commit: ✅ COMPLETED

✅ Add step to execute python scripts/check_versions.py.

✅ Consider: Pass GITHUB_TOKEN as an environment variable to the script if needed for API rate limits (env: GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}).

✅ Add step to check for changes in docs/data.json (e.g., using git diff --quiet docs/data.json || echo "changed=true" >> $GITHUB_ENV).

✅ Add conditional step (if changes detected) to:

✅ Configure Git user name and email.

✅ Commit the updated docs/data.json (e.g., git commit -am "Automated dependency version update").

✅ Push the changes to the main (or default) branch.

### GitHub Pages Configuration: ⏳ USER ACTION REQUIRED

❓ In repository settings, configure GitHub Pages to build from the main (or default) branch and the /docs folder.

### Automation Testing: ⏳ USER ACTION REQUIRED

❓ Push the workflow file and trigger it manually via workflow_dispatch.

❓ Verify the action runs successfully.

❓ Check if docs/data.json is updated and committed.

❓ Check if the GitHub Pages site reflects the changes.

## Phase 4: Refinements, Documentation & Future Prep ✅ COMPLETED

### Refine Error Handling in Script: ✅ COMPLETED

✅ Ensure robust error messages are logged or included in data.json's notes field if a specific dependency check fails.

✅ Ensure the script completes even if one dependency lookup fails.

### Code Comments & Readability: ✅ COMPLETED

✅ Add comments to check_versions.py explaining logic.

✅ Add comments to index.html / script.js if complex.

### Update README.md: ✅ COMPLETED

✅ Document how the system works.

✅ Explain how to add/update dependencies.

✅ Include a link to the GitHub Pages dashboard.

### Consider Input Configuration File: 🔄 FUTURE ENHANCEMENT

⏭️ (Optional Enhancement) Modify check_versions.py to read dependencies from an external JSON or YAML file (e.g., scripts/input_dependencies.json) instead of hardcoding. This makes updates easier.

### Plan for Android Dependencies: 🔄 FUTURE ENHANCEMENT

⏭️ Briefly research how to fetch latest versions for Gradle dependencies (e.g., parsing maven-metadata.xml from Maven repositories like Maven Central, Google Maven).

⏭️ Ensure the Python script's structure can accommodate different fetching strategies based on dependency type (SPM vs. Gradle).

### Post-MVP (Future Iterations): 🔄 FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

⏭️ Implement Android (Gradle) dependency tracking.

⏭️ Add more advanced UI features (sorting, filtering).

⏭️ Add notifications for available updates (e.g., GitHub issue creation, Slack message).
